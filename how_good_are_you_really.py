# There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!
# But you're an ambitious person. You want to know if you're better than the average student in your class.

# You receive an array with your peers' test scores. Now calculate the average and compare your score!

# Return True if you're better, else False!

# Note:
# Your points are not included in the array of your class's points. For calculating the average point you may add your point to the given array!


def better_than_average(class_points, your_points):
    class_avg = sum(class_points) / len(class_points)

    return True if class_avg < your_points else False
